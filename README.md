# Maxcut IBM Quantum Lab Resources

__NOTE__: This project is a work in progress. All jupyter notebooks are meant to be run in the IBM Quantum Lab!

Resource Links: [Hive Plot Raw Data](https://maristcollege-my.sharepoint.com/personal/casimer_decusatis_marist_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fcasimer%5Fdecusatis%5Fmarist%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FHoneypot%20data)

## Getting Started

Each resource is split into folder, containing jupyter notebooks covering algorithmic implementations for maxcutting our honeypot network graphs.
The folders have some sample tests which can be used as templates, and some automated tests on graphs of varying sizes.

## Brute Force

  - jupyter notebooks running the brute force maxcut algorithm on small sample graphs.
  - sample honeypot data

## NumPy Eigenoptimizer

__I'm 51% sure this is classical...__

  - jupyter notebooks running the numpy eigenoptimizer maxcut algorithm on small sample graphs.

## QAOA

  - Sample full QAOA circuit for a simple graph.
  - Automated QAOA tests for 4 & 8 node graphs.

## VQE

  - Sample full VQE circuit for a simple graph.
  - Automated VQE tests for 4 & 8 node graphs.

## Planarity Test

  - Sample planarity test using the networkx library (can be used as a template)
